# Stuff I might like to work on / Random ideas

On a photo page, easy navigation to previous / next photo

On a day page, easy navigation to previous / next day (with photos)
Maybe also jump by week or month

On day page, load-visible (like on list-of-days)

Converge the list-of-days views

When going back (i.e. popstate) to a day page, preserve scroll position.

Web tree-browser (not just photos)

Videos

Video thumbnails

Preserve metadata in Dropbox

Event feed with something more subtle than "something changed, reload the universe"
